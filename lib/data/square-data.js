Once again you begin your routine with a quick bath in whatever puddle you can find, and then it’s off to gather a hearty breakfast. The downtown city landscape is coming alive with busy humans who are certain to leave behind tasty treats for you to discover.'

        squareDesc: 'You glide between mountains of stone and glass, careful not to fly into the deceptively reflective surfaces by accident. The riverfront stretches across the horizon, criss-crossed back and forth with bridges carrying humans in all manner of strange metal animals. They also sit on the grass and on benches to look at the glistening water, and leave behind them a wake of pizza crusts and cheeto dust to sup upon. However other crows are thick here today and the squabbling between them for each morsel is more than you want to deal with today.'

You were taught its sacred meanings from a young age, and now they can be used as a tool for survival. One has to take care however not to be careless when using it'

        squareDesc: 'A rooftop garden tempts you down below, ripe green beans and plump, read tomatoes call your name. You\'ve been pondering for some time how to claim this paradise, but there is always a guardian over your desired feast. A great, big owl stands watch day and night, somehow never moving in the slightest. You\'re starting to suspect something unnatural about this sentinel, but you haven\'t built up the courage yet to investigate further.'

        squareDesc: 'A wide field of grasses and dandelions lay fallow in the shadow of a human nest long abandoned. There are those that come and go, groups of younger humans laughing and sharing a bottle in secret, or sun-touched travelers making music together for whoever will listen. They leave behind all kinds of trinkets and treats hidden in bags and under boxes for one to find, like a reward for solving an especially difficult puzzle.'

        squareDesc: 'A quick rest on a shady branch of bright, pink cherry blossoms is a relief for your tired wings. The hunt for a full belly is more effort some days than others. All around are the sounds of chickadees and robins chattering while they try to accomplish the same chore as you. A little ways away, one frantic starling is fussing over a rain trap that lines a human nest. With interest you draw nearer, and as you\'d hoped the starling has spotted something tasty stuck inside.'

        squareDesc: 'Gliding aimlessly in a slow circle around a few short, city blocks you spot a human drop something tasty looking to the ground below. It\'s a wonder how wasteful these creatures can be, they won\'t eat anything that\'s touched the earth. You intend to wait for them to move on before trying to snatch it up for yourself, but it seems you\'re not the only one with these thoughts. Another crow swoops down at the same time you do and is just that much faster. They grab your breakfast and make off in a flash.'

        squareDesc: 'Your swift wings carry you past the sounds of barking cars and noisy machines, to where there are only small, human nests lined up in neat rows. Little songbirds flitter about looking for caches of suet hung up in gardens for them to find, and hummingbirds drink red poison from plastic flowers. If you’re lucky sometimes there are fragrant fruits in this area, smashed open by their fall to the sidewalk below. It seems the rivaling raccoons and squirrels have already cleared away anything edible however.'

        squareDesc: 'You find a tall wire to rest upon near a wide track, where those noisy, metal animals with their human riders run the fastest. They move like the current of a black river, never stopping or resting, as they flow to a set of rules largely unknown to you. Many creatures great and small have forded the black river and lost their lives. If you\'re lucky they\'ve been thrown to the side for you to clean up, but today you are not so fortunate.'
